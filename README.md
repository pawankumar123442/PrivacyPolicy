# PrivacyPolicy
 1. User Provided Information
We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you:

Register or sign up for an account (e.g., name, age, username, email address, password).

Contact us for support.

Make in-app purchases (note: we do not store credit card details; transactions are handled via secure third-party services).

Enter any information into the app, such as feedback, preferences, or optional profile data.

If you are under the age of digital consent (e.g., under 13 in the U.S. or under 16 in the EU), we do not collect personal data without verified parental consent. We display only age-appropriate content and ads to children, as required by law.

2. Automatically Collected Information
We may collect certain data automatically, such as:

Device type and model

Operating system and version

Unique device identifier (e.g., Android Advertising ID)

IP address (used for general region information, not precise location)

App usage data (e.g., features accessed, session length)

We do not collect precise real-time location data from your mobile device.

3. Advertising and Third-Party Services
To comply with the Families Policy:

We only use Google Play certified ad networks when displaying ads to children.

All ads shown to children are vetted for age-appropriateness.

No behavioral advertising is shown to children under the age of consent.

We do not allow unaffiliated third parties to track children's behavior for advertising or analytics purposes.

We may share non-personally identifiable information with third-party service providers that assist us in improving app functionality and performance. These providers have no independent right to use the information except to provide services on our behalf and are contractually obligated to comply with this privacy policy.

4. Children's Privacy
We are committed to protecting childrenâ€™s privacy:

If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without parental consent, we will promptly delete it.

Parents or legal guardians may review, update, or delete their childâ€™s personal data by contacting us at privacy@applicationsite.com.

If you use a neutral age screen, users identified as children will receive a child-appropriate experience within the app, and all data collection and advertising practices will reflect this.

5. Opt-Out Rights
Users can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. For any data removal or parental access requests, contact us at privacy@applicationsite.com.

6. Data Retention
We retain User Provided data for as long as needed to provide services and for a reasonable period afterward.

Automatically Collected Information may be stored for up to 24 months and then anonymized or deleted.

7. Security
We take reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and we may notify you through the app or email. Continued use of the Application after changes means you accept the updated policy.

9. Your Consent
By using our Application, you consent to our collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are a parent or guardian, you consent on behalf of your child.
